He also gave women official position and sacred responsibilities in the Church by delegating priesthood authority to them through the Relief Society.</span></h4>\n            <h4 style=\"margin:30px 0 0 0\"><strong>Support</strong></h4>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Latter-day Saints’ understanding of priesthood grew over time as a result of revelations received by Joseph Smith.</li>\n                <li>The Relief Society was organized by priesthood authority as an integral part of the Church.</li>\n                <li>\n                    Joseph Smith spoke to the Society using terms associated with priesthood. He “ordained” women and said that Relief Society officers would “preside over the Society.” Furthermore, he told them, “I now turn the key to you in the name of God.”\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>These statements indicate that Joseph delegated priesthood authority to women in the Relief Society.</li>\n                        <li>The meaning of several of these terms has changed over time. Early Latter-day Saints used the term “ordain” in the same way that we now use the term “set apart.” “Keys” had multiple meanings used by Joseph Smith:  authority, knowledge, temple ordinances.</li>\n                        <li>Neither Joseph Smith nor any of his successors conferred Aaronic or Melchizedek priesthood on women or ordained them to priesthood office.</li>\n                    </ul>\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                    Joseph Smith endorsed women’s participation in giving blessings of healing.\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>Church leaders sanctioned women giving blessings to the sick in the 1800s and early 1900s. Male and female leaders taught that women gave these blessings not by priesthood authority but by faith, in the name of Christ, and as a spiritual gift.</li>\n                        <li>Women’s healing practices gradually diminished in the early 1900s.  By 1926, President Heber J. Grant emphasized that “the scriptures tell us to call in the Elders, who hold the priesthood of God and have the power and authority to administer to the sick.”</li>\n                        <li>The current Church Handbook directs that “only worthy Melchizedek Priesthood holders may administer to the sick or afflicted.”</li>\n                    </ul>\n                </li>\n                <li>Joseph’s priesthood-related teachings to the Relief Society were given in the context of the beginning of temple ordinances. He spoke of establishing the Relief Society as a “kingdom of priests”—this “kingdom of priests” would be comprised of men and women who made temple covenants.</li>\n                <li>Before his death, Joseph introduced all of the temple ordinances. These ordinances bestow priesthood power on men and women, not ecclesiastical office.</li>\n                <li>Priesthood keys are the authority God has given priesthood leaders to direct, control and govern the use of His priesthood on earth.  All that is done under the direction of those priesthood keys is done with priesthood authority.</li>\n                <li>With the introduction of temple ordinances, Latter-day Saints came to understand in new ways how men and women are interdependent in achieving exaltation. They learned that women and men together enter into an order of the priesthood when sealed through temple ordinances.</li>\n                <li>The priesthood authority exercised by Latter-day Saint women in the temple and elsewhere remains largely unrecognized by people outside the Church and is sometimes misunderstood or overlooked by those within. Latter-day Saints and others often mistakenly equate priesthood with religious office and the men who hold it, which obscures the broader Latter-day Saint concept of priesthood.</li>\n                <li>Women of the Church today exercise priesthood authority in their callings even though they are not ordained to priesthood office. Many of the functions women fulfill within the Church would require ordination in other religious traditions.</li>\n                <li>Latter-day Saint women and men collaborate in the work of the Lord and do so with priesthood power and authority. This interdependence of men and women in accomplishing God’s work through His power is central to the gospel of Jesus Christ.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>For more on this topic, including the sources of statements quoted above, see <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/joseph-smiths-teachings-about-priesthood-temple-and-women?lang=eng\" target=\"_blank\">churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/joseph-smiths-teachings-about-priesthood-temple-and-women</a>.</p>\n        ", "create.bishop.determined.not.accountable": "Has the bishop determined that the person is not accountable?", "settings.meeting.times": "Meeting Times", "new-recommendation.patriarch.provide.divorce.details": "Provide divorce details", "messages.application.readmission.success.message.other.user.reporting.up.to.mission": "This readmission requires the approval of the First Presidency.

As Latter-day Saints, we believe that all people are children of God in a full and complete sense. All have the seeds of divinity within them that allow them to grow and become like God. This eternal progression, however, will never change His identity as our Father and our God. </span></h4>\n            <h4 style=\"margin:30px 0 0 0\"><strong>Support</strong></h4>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Several biblical passages teach that humans can become like God. For example, the book of Genesis says that in the beginning, God “created man in his own image” (<a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/ot/gen/1.27?lang=eng#26\" target=\"_blank\">Genesis 1:27</a>). The Apostle Paul taught that we are “the offspring of God” and thus “heirs of God” (<a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/nt/acts/17.29?lang=eng#28\" target=\"_blank\">Acts 17:29</a>;  <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/nt/rom/8.16-17?lang=eng#15\" target=\"_blank\">Romans 8:16–17</a>). </li>\n\n                <li>Many church fathers—influential theologians in early Christianity—spoke approvingly of the idea that humans can become divine. But the philosophical notion that God created the universe ex nihilo—out of nothing—led many Christians after the second century to conclude that God had been completely alone in the beginning. This teaching widened the perceived gulf between God and humans.</li>\n\n                <li>Revelations to Joseph Smith rejected ex nihilo creation. “Man was also in the beginning with God,” the Lord declared. The light, or intelligence, at the core of every human person, the Lord said, “was not created or made, neither indeed can be” (<a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.29?lang=eng#28\" target=\"_blank\">D&amp;C 93:29</a>).</li>\n\n                <li>In his King Follett discourse, Joseph Smith taught that human nature was, at its core, divine. He taught that God instituted laws whereby His children “could have a privilege to advance like himself.”</li>\n\n                <li>Since Joseph Smith’s time, modern prophets have repeatedly taught that humans have within them the capacity to become like God. For example, Church President Lorenzo Snow taught, “As man now is, God once was: As God now is, man may be.”</li>\n\n                <li>The Church rejects polytheism, or the worship of a pantheon of competing gods. Latter-day Saints worship the Father—and only the Father—in the name of Christ.</li>\n\n                <li>Church members view the afterlife through the lens of mortal experience. They see the seeds of godhood in the joy of bearing and nurturing children and the intense love they feel for those children. The cartoonish image of people receiving their own planets distorts the truth.</li>\n\n                <li>Becoming like God is not inevitable.

We worship God the Eternal Father in the name of Jesus Christ and declare that Christ’s name is the only name under heaven by which salvation comes. We are not fourth- or fifth-century Christians with creeds. We believe, rather, as the church members in New Testament times believed. All who love, worship, and follow Christ should be free to seek an understanding of His doctrine according to the direction of the Holy Spirit without being called non-Christian.</span></h4>\n            <h4 style=\"margin:30px 0 0 0\"><strong>Support</strong></h4>\n            <ul>\n                <li>People who say Mormons are not Christian typically point to one or more of the following reasons:\n                    <ol>\n                        <li>Mormons do not accept the creeds of post–New Testament Christianity regarding the Trinity.</li>\n                        <li>Mormons do not descend from the main lines of traditional Christianity. That is, they are not Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, or Protestant.</li>\n                        <li>Mormons do not believe that the scriptural canon consists in the Holy Bible alone. They expand the canon to include the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price.</li>\n                    </ol>\n                </li>\n                <li>Latter-day Saints affirm that the creeds of post–New Testament Christianity are misguided. For example, early Christians believed in a personal God who was embodied. The creeds removed that view. We affirm that the members of the Godhead are one in every way except physically.  In His high priestly prayer recorded in John 17, the Lord prayed to His Father, who is our Father.</li>\n                <li>Even though Latter-day Saints may disagree with other Christians on the precise nature of God, the roles they ascribe to the Godhead largely correspond. For example, Latter-day Saints pray to the Father in the name of Christ, believe that Jesus Christ atoned for the sins of mankind, and believe that the Holy Spirit witnesses of divine truth.</li>\n                <li>The traditional divisions of Christianity—Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant—have disagreed on many points of doctrine. There is room in the Christian fold for disagreement without saying that people with different beliefs cannot be Christian.</li>\n                <li>Many Protestant Christians define their faith by belief in the principle of sola scriptura, or the self-sufficiency of the Bible. While we believe the Bible to be the word of God (as far as it is translated correctly) we believe in additional scripture, as mentioned above. In reality, no branch of Christianity relies entirely on the Bible in making doctrinal decisions. If other Christians treat sources outside the Bible as authoritative, it is inconsistent to exclude Latter-day Saints from the Christian fold for this reason.</li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <p>For more on this topic, see <a href=\"http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/christians?lang=eng\" target=\"_blank\">churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/christians</a>.</p>\n        ", "writing-system.Thai": "Thai", "custom-reports.days": "Days", "callings.stake.calling.authorized.edit": "This is a stake calling, and only authorized stake leaders are able to edit this calling.", "common.confirmed": "Confirmed", "record.no.marriage.termination.date.day": "No day was specified for the marriage status change date.", "recommend.physical.signature.info": "Recording who physically signed allows for reprinting if the recommend is lost, stolen, or damaged.", "record.ordination.date.label.9": "Apostle ordination date:", "ord.print.info.2": "The Priesthood Ordination Record form is to be used by the bishop, clerk, and candidate to track the ordination.

For example, one recent study argues that as much as one-third of Native American DNA originated anciently in Europe or West Asia. </li>\n\n                <li>The Book of Mormon does not claim that the peoples it describes were either the predominant or the exclusive inhabitants of the lands they occupied.

Is this true? </span></h4>\n            <h4><strong>Primary message: </strong> <span>In both doctrine and practice, the Church teaches its members to be a peace-loving people. Latter-day Saints follow the Savior, the Prince of Peace, and seek to love and forgive as He does. Though Church members have not always measured up to these high ideals, the vast majority of Latter-day Saints have sought to live peaceable lives.</span></h4>\n            <h4 style=\"margin:30px 0 0 0\"><strong>Support</strong></h4>\n            <ul>\n                <li>In the first two decades after the Church was organized, Latter-day Saints were often the victims of violence. Mobs repeatedly drove Church members from place to place. Despite these difficulties, the Saints sought to live by revelations that counseled them to live in peace with their neighbors.</li>\n\n                <li>In response to violence against them, Church leaders and members repeatedly appealed to the rule of law by seeking redress from local and state governments. When these attempts failed, some Church members responded on some occasions with defensive—and, at times, retaliatory—actions.</li>\n\n                <li>The isolated acts of violence committed both by and against Latter-day Saints can be seen as a subset of the broader phenomenon of American extralegal and frontier violence, in which some citizens organized to take justice into their own hands.</li>\n\n                <li>Peaceful accommodation between Latter-day Saints and American Indians was both the ideal and the norm. The Saints befriended Indians and generally had more amicable relations with them than did many other western settlers. At times, however, Church members clashed violently with Indians, mistreating and killing them in numerous conflicts, much as other frontier Americans did in the 19th century.</li>\n\n                <li>Retaliation by Latter-day Saints against their perceived enemies occurred most frequently during the first decade of Utah settlement (1847–57). During the Mormon reformation of the mid-1850s, Church leaders sometimes preached fiery, hyperbolic rhetoric. In 1857, United States President James Buchanan sent an army to put down an alleged rebellion in Utah.</li>\n\n                <li>At the peak of these tensions with outsiders, a group of Mormon militiamen laid siege to a wagon train of emigrants traveling through southern Utah in September 1857. Unaware of President Brigham Young’s order to “not meddle” with passing emigrants, they brutally slaughtered 120 men, women, and children, sparing only small children.

Teachings about the premortal life, the Creation, and the purpose of earth life make the book of Abraham unique among other books of scripture. The book of Abraham is consistent with details known today about the ancient world. The status of the book of Abraham as scripture ultimately rests on faith in the saving truths found within the book itself, not in the method of its translation.</span></h4>\n            <h4 style=\"margin:30px 0 0 0\"><strong>Support</strong></h4>\n            <ul>\n                <li>The word translation typically assumes expertise in at least two languages. Joseph Smith claimed no expertise in any language. He could not translate without God’s help. By the gift and power of God, Joseph received knowledge about the life and teachings of Abraham.</li>\n\n                <li>Between 1835 and 1842, Joseph Smith translated the book of Abraham from papyrus scrolls found in the catacombs of Egypt and sold to the Church. Many people saw the papyri, but no eyewitness account of translation survives, making it difficult to reconstruct the process.</li>\n\n                <li>After Joseph Smith’s death, the scrolls changed hands several times. Ten fragments ended up in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. In 1967, the museum transferred the fragments to the Church, and the Church soon published the fragments in one of its magazines. </li>\n\n                <li>Mormon and non-Mormon scholars agree that the characters on the fragments of text do not match the translation given in the book of Abraham.</li>\n\n                <li>The relationship between the fragments and the book of Abraham is largely a matter of conjecture. One possibility is that the papyri Joseph Smith used to translate the book of Abraham is missing from the extant fragments. Eyewitnesses spoke of “long rolls” or multiple “rolls” of papyrus. Since only fragments survive, it is likely that much of the papyri accessible to Joseph Smith are not among these fragments. Joseph’s translation may have originated from the lost portion of the papyri. In any event, the relationship of the papyri to the published text cannot be settled definitively.</li>\n\n                <li>Alternately, Joseph’s study of the papyri may have led to a revelation about Abraham in much the same way he had earlier received a revelation about the life of Moses while studying the Bible. In this case, Joseph’s translation would not be a literal rendering of the papyri, as a conventional translation would be. Rather, the physical artifacts would have served as a catalyst for meditation, reflection, and revelation.</li>\n\n                <li>Elements of the book of Abraham fit comfortably in the ancient world, supporting the claim that the book of Abraham is an ancient book. Human sacrifice, Abraham’s instructing Egyptian priests in knowledge of the heavens, and other small details found in the book are found in other ancient Egyptian manuscripts that were unavailable to Joseph Smith.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>For more on this topic, including the sources of statements quoted above, see <a href=\"http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/translation-and-historicity-of-the-book-of-abraham?lang=eng\" target=\"_blank\">churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/translation-and-historicity-of-the-book-of-abraham</a></p>\n        ", "tinymce.Decrease indent": "Decrease indent", "typeMismatch.java.lang.Integer": "Invalid number", "quarterly-report.converts.12.and.older": "Total converts age 12 and older baptized and confirmed in the last 12 months", "global.proxy.start.proxy": "Start Proxy", "custom-reports.has.visiting.teachers": "Has Ministering Sisters", "new-recommendation.bishop.qual.reference": "(1 Timothy 3:2-7)", "new-recommendation.patriarch.copyright": "© 2010 IRI.

Some of these members have strong testimonies. They come simply seeking clarification. Others may have weaker testimonies or even serious doubts about fundamental gospel principles. They come seeking strength, support, comfort, and healing.</p>\n            <p>This is an opportunity for you to lift and strengthen these members by the guidance of the Spirit—to “comfort those that stand in need of comfort.”<sup class=\"noteMarker\" noteref=\"1\"><a href=\"#references\">1</a></sup> Listen carefully.  Do not dismiss any sincere question or concern as unimportant, trivial, unhealthy, or sinful. Remember that the Restoration of the gospel began with a sincere question.</p>\n            <p>“A testimony . . . is as hard to hold as a moonbeam,” President Harold B. Lee taught. “It is something you have to recapture every day of your life.”<sup class=\"noteMarker\" noteref=\"2\"><a href=\"#references\">2</a></sup> You can help members recapture and strengthen the testimony they have already received. Counsel them to seek the influence of the Holy Ghost, who nurtures testimony, imparts knowledge, and gives peace to those who believe. Remind them that they invite the companionship of the Holy Ghost when they pray, study the scriptures and the words of living prophets, and keep the commandments of God.  As the Savior said, they “shall know of the doctrine” when they strive to “do [God’s] will.<sup class=\"noteMarker\" noteref=\"3\"><a href=\"#references\">3</a></sup> He also promised: “The Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.”<sup class=\"noteMarker\" noteref=\"4\"><a href=\"#references\">4</a></sup> </p>\n            <p>In providing comfort and counsel, invite members to embrace the truths they already know. Like Nephi of old, they can find assurance in the knowledge that God “loveth his children” even when they “do not know the meaning of all things.”<sup class=\"noteMarker\" noteref=\"5\"><a href=\"#references\">5</a></sup> Help them have confidence in “the simplicity that is in Christ”<sup class=\"noteMarker\" noteref=\"6\"><a href=\"#references\">6</a></sup>—in the reality of His Atonement and Resurrection and in the beauty and completeness of the plan of redemption as made known through God’s latter-day prophets. </p>\n            <p>Encourage members to increase their knowledge of gospel truths, always following the counsel to “seek learning, even by study <i>and also by faith</i>.”<sup class=\"noteMarker\" noteref=\"7\"><a href=\"#references\">7</a></sup> It is essential that they hold to, and exercise faith as they seek additional understanding.<sup class=\"noteMarker\" noteref=\"8\"><a href=\"#references\">8</a></sup> Moreover, they should seek to learn “out of the best books,”<sup class=\"noteMarker\" noteref=\"9\"><a href=\"#references\">9</a></sup> which means giving priority to the scriptures and other writings that invite the guidance of the Holy Ghost. This counsel applies to their use of the Internet. The Internet is a marvelous tool when used toward righteous ends. Nonetheless, the adversary and those who “lie in wait to deceive”<sup class=\"noteMarker\" noteref=\"10\"><a href=\"#references\">10</a></sup> use the Internet and other sources to sow confusion and doubt. Help members find strength and safety in the scriptures and the teachings of living apostles and prophets, that they may not be deceived “by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness.”<sup class=\"noteMarker\" noteref=\"11\"><a href=\"#references\">11</a></sup></p>\n            <p>The following resources have been prepared to help you “be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you.”<sup class=\"noteMarker\" noteref=\"12\"><a href=\"#references\">12</a></sup> </p>\n\n            <div id=\"addlResources\">\n                <h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\n                <p>Dieter F.

Subsequent Presidents of the Church restricted blacks, both men and women, from receiving the temple endowment and being married in the temple. </li>\n\n                <li>In the same speech in which he announced the priesthood restriction, President Young said that at some future day, black Church members would “have [all] the privilege and more” enjoyed by other members.</li>\n\n                <li>In June 1978, the First Presidency announced that God “has heard our prayers, and by revelation has confirmed that the long-promised day has come” (<a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/dc-testament/od/2?lang=eng\" target=\"_blank\">Official Declaration 2</a>). The revelation rescinded the restriction on priesthood ordination. It also extended the blessings of the temple to all worthy Latter-day Saints, men and women. Reaction to the revelation was overwhelmingly positive among Church members of all races.</li>\n\n                <li>Between 1852 and 1978, Church members put forward various theories to explain the priesthood and temple restrictions. None of these theories is accepted as the doctrine of the Church. Today the Church disavows that black skin is a sign of divine disfavor or curse; that it reflects unrighteous actions in the premortal life; that mixed-race marriages are sinful; and that blacks or any other race or ethnicity are inferior in any way to anyone else.</li>\n\n                <li>The Church condemns racism, past and present, in any form.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>For more on this topic, including the sources of statements quoted above, see <a href=\"http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/race-and-the-priesthood?lang=eng\" target=\"_blank\">churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/race-and-the-priesthood</a>.</p>\n        ", "move.invalid.mrn": "The membership record number is invalid.", "messages.report.misconduct.murder": "Murder", "cmis.constraints.endowment.date.must.precede.sealing.date": "An endowment date must precede the sealing to spouse date.", "messages.married": "Married:", "cmis.constraints.priesthood.memberNotInUnit": "Member not found in this unit", "common.f.short.label": "F", "common.reject": "Reject", "manage-photos.edit.photo": "Edit Photo", "officers-sustained.propose.branch.hp": "As the leaders of the branch group of the stake high priests quorum:", "leader-messaging.all-ward-mission-leaders": "All Ward Mission Leaders", "stats.young.women": "Young Women", "ord.full.name": "Member's full name", "dashboard.create.record.description": "Select <strong>Create Record</strong> from the Membership menu.", "ministering.individuals.interviewed": "Individuals Interviewed This Quarter", "common.quick.links": "Quick Links", "recommend.book.shredded": "The recommend book for this recommend has been reported as shredded", "ord.person.that.performed.confirmation": "Person who performed the confirmation", "tinymce.Robots": "Robots", "messages.could.not.find.page.requested": "Could not find the requested page", "callings.custom.callings": "Custom Callings", "dashboard.2014.training.summary": "Church leaders counsel about the sacred setting of the home as the center for learning and provide a vision for how gospel teachers can teach with power.", "recommend.physical.signatures": "Physical Signatures", "menu.church.handbooks": "Church Handbook", "record.mission.president.record.ordination": "Only the mission president can record this ordination.", "officers-sustained.sustain.presidency.female.youth": "{{param0}}, president; {{param1}}, first counselor; and {{param2}}, second counselor; with {{param3}}, secretary.", "progress-record.parent.unit.message": "Please select a unit from the unit selector to view the Covenant Path Progress.", "officers-sustained.sustain.presidency.male.youth": "{{param0}}, president; {{param1}}, first counselor; and {{param2}}, second counselor; with {{param3}}, secretary.", "move.individual.already.in.unit": "The requested individual is already in the {{param0}}.", "create.children.select.gender": "<a href=\"\" ui-sref=\"create-wizard.individual\">Gender</a> must be selected before children can be recorded.", "mbr-audit.leaders": "Leaders", "beta.features.in.this.beta": "Features in This Beta", "menu.issue.limited.use.recommends": "Recommend for Baptisms", "new-recommendation.form.name": "Form Name", "endowed-members-without-recommend.page.title": "Endowed Members without Recommend", "writing-system.validation.writing.system.not.expected": "Writing system not expected", "500.server.error": "The server is currently unavailable because it is overloaded or down for maintenance.

Two of them were published during his lifetime. In addition to these four accounts, five other accounts of the First Vision were recorded by contemporaries who heard Joseph Smith speak about the experience.  </li>\n                <li>The account published today in the Pearl of Great Price is the longest and most complete account. Because it was published during Joseph Smith’s lifetime and prepared as part of the official Church history, it is used as the Church’s official version. </li>\n                <li>Those who question Joseph Smith’s descriptions of the First Vision often resort to one of two arguments: (1) Joseph Smith’s memory was faulty; or (2) Joseph embellished his story over time. </li>\n                <li>Those who claim that Joseph Smith’s memory was faulty question whether religious revivals occurred in Palmyra, New York, in 1820, as he said. Historians have long recognized that western New York was one of the hotbeds of religious revivals in the 1810s and 1820s. Personal journals and newspapers provide evidence that revivals took place in the area near Palmyra between 1818 and 1820. </li>\n                <li>Those who claim that Joseph Smith embellished his story contend that he first told people he had seen one divine personage and expanded the story over time to say he had seen the Father and the Son.  This view underestimates the consistency across the accounts. For example, of the accounts produced by Joseph Smith, three of four accounts clearly say he saw two divine personages.  </li>\n                <li>In the account that does not clearly say he saw two divine personages, which was published in 1832, Joseph does not say that he saw only one personage. He says, “The Lord opened the heavens upon me and I saw the Lord.” In this case, “the Lord” could refer to Jesus Christ alone, who forgave Joseph of his sins; alternatively, it could refer to the Father (“the Lord”) opening the heavens followed by the Son (“the Lord”). </li>\n                <li>Normal differences in audience, setting, and the nature of each account (written or dictated) largely explain the differences between the First Vision accounts. </li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>For more on this topic, see <a href=\"http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/first-vision-accounts?lang=eng\" target=\"_blank\">churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/first-vision-accounts</a>.</p>\n        ", "create.wizard.household": "Household", "create.name.person.performed.blessing": "Name of person who performed the blessing", "mbr-audit.errors.to.correct": "There are membership errors that need to be corrected.", "calendar.day.short.4": "Wed", "calendar.day.short.5": "Thu", "menu.worldwide.leadership.training": "Worldwide Leadership Training", "calendar.day.short.6": "Fri", "calendar.day.short.7": "Sat", "messages.comma": ",", "ord.recommendation.submitted.success": "The recommendation has been submitted, and the stake, district or mission has been notified.", "record.delete.father.confirmation": "Are you sure you want to remove this father?", "common.mission.clerk": "Mission Clerk (Ecclesiastical)", "manage-photos.choose.from.device": "Choose Photos from Your Device", "member-lookup.view.member.profile": "View Member Profile", "record.request.has.been.submitted": "A request for updated membership record information has been submitted.

Like the beginning of plural marriage in the Church, the end of the practice was a process rather than a single event. Revelation came to leaders and members “line upon line, precept upon precept” (<a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.12?lang=eng#11\" target=\"_blank\">D&amp;C 98:12</a>).</span></h4>\n            <h4 style=\"margin:30px 0 0 0\"><strong>Support</strong></h4>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Beginning in 1862, the United States government passed laws designed to force Latter-day Saints to stop plural marriage. These laws subjected guilty persons to prison and fines. They also disincorporated the Church and allowed the government to seize Church properties. The laws were upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. </li>\n\n                <li>Latter-day Saints sincerely desired to be loyal citizens of the United States. They also accepted plural marriage as a commandment from God and believed the court was unjustly depriving them of their right to follow God’s commands.  </li>\n\n                <li>Confronted with these contradictory allegiances, Church members embarked on a course of civil disobedience in the 1880s, continuing to live in and enter into plural marriages. During those years, many polygamists went into hiding, moving from house to house. Others assumed aliases and moved out of the country. </li>\n\n                <li>In September 1890, Church President Wilford Woodruff issued the Manifesto, which declared his intention to “submit to those laws [passed by the government], and to use my influence with the members of the Church … to have them do likewise” (<a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/dc-testament/od/1?lang=eng\" target=\"_blank\">Official Declaration 1</a>). The Manifesto was accepted by vote of the Church membership at general conference. </li>\n\n                <li>Church members living in 1890 generally believed the Manifesto was God’s will, but the full implications of the document were not apparent at first. Some new marriages were performed after the Manifesto, between 1890 and 1904, with the approval of Church leaders. Most of those marriages took place in Canada and Mexico, beyond U.S. law. </li>\n\n                <li>The precise number of new plural marriages performed between 1890 and 1904 is unknown. The best estimate comes from a historical ledger of “marriages and sealings performed outside the temple,” which lists 290 (92%) monogamous marriages and 25 (8%) plural marriages. </li>\n\n                <li>In April 1904, Church President Joseph F. Smith issued the Second Manifesto, which prohibited new plural marriages and subjected violators to withdrawal of membership. From then on, Church members who have publicly advocated or entered into new plural marriages have been summoned to Church membership councils. Church leaders have repeatedly emphasized that the Church and its members are no longer authorized to enter into plural marriage. </li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>For more on this topic, including the sources of statements quoted above, see <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/plural-marriage-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints?lang=eng\" target=\"_blank\">churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/plural-marriage-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints</a>.</p>\n        ", "ministering.show.photos": "Show Photos", "dashboard.quick.links": "Quick Links", "common.search.results.organizations": "Organizations", "custom-reports.address.street1": "Address - Street 1", "new-recommendation.patriarch.provide.discp.details": "Provide membership council action details", "custom-reports.address.street2": "Address - Street 2", "ord.priesthood.successfully.recorded": "Priesthood ordination successfully recorded", "ail.select.report.instructions": "Please select a report section above.

Joseph Smith consistently testified that he translated the book by the “gift and power of God.” Historical records affirm that Joseph Smith used both the Nephite interpreters as well as a single seer stone to translate the plates.</span></h4>\n\n            <h4 style=\"margin:30px 0 0 0\"><strong>Support</strong></h4>\n            <ul>\n                <li>In biblical times, physical instruments often facilitated God’s power and inspiration. Israelite priests used the Urim and Thummim to assist in receiving divine communications. Other physical instruments in the Bible include the rod of Aaron, a brass serpent, holy anointing oils, the Ark of the Covenant, and dirt from the ground mixed with saliva to heal the eyes of a blind man.</li>\n\n                <li>Joseph Smith stands out among God’s prophets, because God called him to render into his own language an entire volume of scripture amounting to more than 500 printed pages. For this monumental task, God prepared additional help in the form of physical instruments.</li>\n\n                <li>According to eyewitnesses, Joseph Smith used two different instruments in translating the Book of Mormon. One instrument was the Nephite “interpreters” or “spectacles” found with the plates. This instrument consisted of a pair of two clear stones bound together with a metal rim. The other instrument was a small oval stone, or “seer stone,” Joseph Smith found in the ground before retrieving the plates.</li>\n\n                <li>The interpreters and the seer stone were apparently interchangeable and worked in much the same way. Over time, Joseph Smith and his associates came to use the biblical term “Urim and Thummim” to refer to both the seer stone and the interpreters.</li>\n\n                <li>Eyewitnesses left accounts of the translation process. Most accounts speak of Joseph Smith’s use of the Urim and Thummim (either the interpreters or the seer stone), and many accounts refer to his use of a single stone. According to these accounts, Joseph at times placed either the interpreters or the seer stone in a hat to block out extraneous light, and read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument.</li>\n\n                <li>The process calls to mind a passage from the Book of Mormon that speaks of God preparing “a stone, which shall shine forth in darkness unto light” (<a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.23-24?lang=eng#22\" target=\"_blank\">Alma 37:23-24</a>).</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>For more on this topic, including the sources of statements quoted above, see <a href=\"http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/book-of-mormon-translation?lang=eng\" target=\"_blank\">churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/book-of-mormon-translation</a>.</p>\n        ", "messages.report.misconduct.embezzlement": "Embezzlement of Church funds", "mbr-audit.e41": "The marriage date cannot be earlier than the spouse's birth date.", "create.summary.husband.member.status": "Husband’s Member Status", "common.possible.changes": "Possible Changes Have Been Made", "leader-messaging.elders": "Elders", "settings.print.settings": "Print Settings", "callings.class.teachers.quorum": "Teachers Quorum", "progress-record.mp.remove.filters": "Remove", "recommend.void.recommend": "Void Recommend", "employment.no.individuals": "There are no individuals in your unit who have requested employment help.", "temple-entry.is.required": "is required", "forms.ward.branch.organization": "Ward or Branch Organization Application", "mbr-audit.e39": "No spouse surname or given name has been entered.

God commanded the adoption and then later the cessation of plural marriage in the Church. After receiving a revelation on plural marriage, Joseph Smith married multiple wives and introduced the practice to close associates. Plural marriage was one of the most challenging aspects of the Restoration. It tested faith and provoked controversy and opposition. But many testified of powerful spiritual experiences that gave them the courage to enter into this practice. </span></h4>\n            <h4 style=\"margin:30px 0 0 0\"><strong>Support</strong></h4>\n            <ul>\n                <li>The revelation on plural marriage was part of a larger revelation on eternal marriage, recorded today in Doctrine and Covenants 132. The revelation was written down in 1843, but part of it likely emerged from Joseph Smith’s study of the Old Testament in 1831. God commanded various ancient patriarchs to marry multiple wives, and as part of the restoration of all things, He commanded members of the restored Church for a time to do the same. </li>\n\n                <li>Polygamy had been permitted for millennia in many cultures and religions, but it was overwhelmingly rejected in Western cultures. In Joseph Smith’s time, monogamy was the only form of marriage legally permissible in the United States.</li>\n\n                <li>Joseph Smith was reluctant to practice plural marriage. He told associates that an angel appeared to him three times between 1834 and 1842 and commanded him to proceed. </li>\n\n                <li>Latter-day Saints’ motives for plural marriage were more religious than romantic. Participants were “sealed” to one another, linking their families together after death. Besides a desire to be obedient, participants looked forward to “crowns of eternal lives” and “exaltation in the eternal worlds” as a result of their obedience (<a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.55,63?lang=eng#54\" target=\"_blank\">D&amp;C 132:55, 63</a>). </li>\n\n                <li>Joseph Smith married his first plural wife in the 1830s in Ohio. He married additional wives in Nauvoo, some for time and eternity and others for eternity only. Some of the women sealed to Joseph Smith were already married to other men. This practice may have been a way to (1) create an eternal bond between Joseph’s family and other families, (2) comply with the Lord’s command without entering into normal marriage relationships, or (3) help women whose marriages were either unhappy or compromised.</li>\n\n                <li>Joseph and his first wife, Emma, loved each other deeply, and plural marriage was a trial for them. Emma accepted plural marriage for a time but eventually rejected the practice.</li>\n\n                <li>Many Saints in Nauvoo later testified that God gave them an unmistakable spiritual witness that helped them feel justified in entering into plural marriage.</li>\n\n                <li>One of the Lord’s purpose in commanding the practice of plural marriage for a period of time was to “raise up seed unto [Him]” (<a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.30?lang=eng#29\" target=\"_blank\">Jacob 2:30</a>).</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>For more on this topic, see <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/plural-marriage-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints?lang=eng\" target=\"_blank\">churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/plural-marriage-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints</a>.</p>\n        ", "dashboard.issue.temple.recommends.link": "Issue Temple Recommends", "common.president.x": "President {{param0}}", "manage-photos.household": "Household", "recommend.limited.use.valid.through": "Valid through:", "ministering.annotation.present.others": "The {{param0}} must record this assignment.", "menu.confidential.actions.process": "Confidential Actions in Process", "leader-messaging.search-recipients-by-calling-info-help": "You can search by name or calling.

Despite the hardships some experienced, the faithfulness of those who practiced plural marriage continues to benefit the Church in innumerable ways. The descendants of those early Saints include righteous mothers and fathers, loyal disciples of Christ, and devoted members and missionaries. </span></h4>\n            <h4 style=\"margin:30px 0 0 0\"><strong>Support</strong></h4>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Latter-day Saints do not understand all of God’s purposes for instituting the practice of plural marriage in the 19th century. The Book of Mormon identifies one reason: to “raise up seed unto [the Lord]” (<a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.30?lang=eng#29\" target=\"_blank\">Jacob 2:30</a>). In addition to bringing a large number of births to faithful homes, plural marriage shaped Mormon society in other ways: marriage became available to virtually all who desired it; per-capita inequality of wealth was diminished; ethnic intermarriages increased; and social cohesion and group identification were strengthened.</li>\n\n                <li>Plural marriage was first publicly taught in Utah in 1852. For the next four decades, all Latter-day Saints were expected to accept the principle as God’s will. Not all, however, were expected to live it. Church leaders viewed plural marriage as a command to the Church generally, but individuals who did not enter the practice could still stand approved of God. </li>\n\n                <li>According to historical research, two-thirds of polygamist men had only two wives at a time. Women married at young ages (age 16 or 17 or, infrequently, younger), which was typical of women living in frontier areas at the time. Probably half of those living in Utah Territory in 1857 experienced life in a polygamous family as a husband, wife, or child at some time in their lives. That percentage declined over the next three decades. </li>\n\n                <li>Women were free to choose their spouses and to choose whether to enter into a polygamous or monogamous union or to not marry at all. Divorce and remarriage were permitted.</li>\n\n                <li>Accounts left by men and women who practiced plural marriage report challenges and difficulties. The accounts also record the love and joy many found within their families.</li>\n\n                <li>In 1890, President Wilford Woodruff issued the Manifesto, which led to the end of plural marriage in the Church.  (See “The Manifesto and the End of Plural Marriage,” below). Plural marriage had never been encouraged outside of concentrated populations of Latter-day Saints, and as the Church spread beyond the American West, the monogamous nuclear family was well suited for an increasingly dispersed membership.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>For more on this topic, see <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/plural-marriage-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints?lang=eng\" target=\"_blank\">churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/plural-marriage-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints</a></p>\n        ", "temple-entry.physical.signature.tooltip": "Selecting who interviewed and physically signed the recommend allows for\n      reprinting if the recommend is lost, stolen, or damaged.\n    ", "messages.application.readmission.success.message.other.user": "This readmission requires the approval of the First Presidency.
